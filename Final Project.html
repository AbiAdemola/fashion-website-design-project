            <strong>What is High Fashion?</strong>
            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/shecodesio-production/uploads/files/000/034/826/original/haute_couture.jpg?1653135932"

            <br />
            The phrase ‚Äúhigh fashion‚Äù refers to the most luxurious, elegant and expensive clothing and accessories from
            top
            fashion
            designers. This American term comes from a common French expression, <em>‚ÄúHaute Couture,‚Äù</em> which has the
            same meaning.
            High-fashion clothing is typically custom-made women‚Äôs clothing.
            <br />
            <strong>What is Commercial Fashion?</strong>
            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/shecodesio-production/uploads/files/000/034/756/original/commercial_fashion.jpg?1653064291"
                alt="commercial fashion" />
            <br />
            Commercial fashion can simply be classified as the everyday fashion, a representation of a more approachable
            and
            realistic look.
            It encompasses all other types of clothings including official / formal or unofficial / informal, e.g.,
            suits,
            fitness clothings, lingerie and party wears and so on.

            <br />
            <strong>What is Alternative Fashion?</strong>
            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/shecodesio-production/uploads/files/000/034/757/original/alternative_fashion.jpg?1653064970"
                alt="alternative fashion" />
            <br />
            Alternative fashion or Alt fashion is fashion that stands apart from mainstream commercial fashion.
            Alternative
            fashion includes the fashions of specific subcultures such as emo, scene, goth subculture, hip hop,
            cyberpunk,
            kawaii,
            cottagecore, goblincore, 70's core, and Lolita fashion; however, it is not limited to these. In general,
            alternative,
            or 'alt', fashion does not conform to widely popular style trends of the times that have widespread
            popularity.
            It may exhibit itself as a fringe style ‚Äì extremely attention-grabbing and more artistic than practical ‚Äì
            but it
            can
            also develop from anti-fashion sentiments that focus on simplistic utilitarian drives (e.g.: grunge fashion,
            which
            was largely based around comfort and availability).
